**Vibrant Meals**

This is the working copy of the new Vibrant Meals website.  It is being written using the AdonisJS framework on top of the AdonisJS Hackathon Starter boilerplate.  The only modification that has been made to the boilerplate so far is to swap out Bootstrap for Bulma CSS.

**11/12/18**

Initial developement begins.  Switched out Bootstrap for Bulma CSS at the moment.  Currently working on sketching out the database details.  You can look under database/migrations to see what the template looks like so far.  That folder contains the code that will be ran in order to create the database.

**Testing out the code**

I will set up a staging server soon.  In the meantime, you can run this code by doing the following:

```
git clone https://code.enxo.co/murph/vibrant-meals
cd vibrant-meals
npm install
```
